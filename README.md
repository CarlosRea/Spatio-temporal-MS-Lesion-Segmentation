## Usage
Before the models can be trained or tested, the paths in the config files (located in `configs/`) have to be adjusted:
- `data_loader.args.data_dir` specifies where the data is located
-  `trainer.save_dir` specifies where to store the model checkpoints and logs.

### Train
To run the experiments from our paper the following table specifies the commands to run:

| Network                                      | Command                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multitask Longitudinal Network               | python train.py -c Multitask_Longitudinal_Network.py              |
| Baseline Longitudinal Network                | python train.py -c Longitudinal_Network.py                        |
| Baseline Static Network                      | python train.py -c Static_Network.py                              |
| Longitudinal Siamese Network                 | python train.py -c Longitudinal_Siamese_Network.py                |
| Static Network (Zhang et al. [2])            | python train.py -c Static_Network_Zhang.py -s True                |
| Static Network (Asymmetric Dice Loss [12])   | python train.py -c Static_Network_Asymmetric.py                   |


### Resuming from checkpoints
Resume the training form a certain checkpoint can be done by executing:

  ```
  python train.py --resume path/to/checkpoint
  ```

### Test
A trained model can be tested by executing `test.py` passing the path to the trained checkpoint to the `--resume` argument.
For the networks which use a separate model for each plane orientation, the model can be tested with `test_single_view.py`. 
Here the _parent folder_ of a checkpoint has to be provided as the `--resume` argument.

For testing a **longitudinal** model we perform a majority vote over all possible combinates for a given target image with its reference images. 
A longitudinal model usually has a reference image(timepoint t-1) and the target/follow-up image(timepoint t) as input. 
Our experiments have shown that we achieve the best performance when applying a majority vote over all possible permutations for a certain target image. 
This means, for a patient with four timesteps t ∈ {0; 1; 2; 3} and having t = 1 as the target image, we do 
a majority votes over the probability outputs of the inputs (reference, target): (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1).

### General notes
All hyperparameters are defined in the config file.
Majority vote for merging the outputs of the different plane orientations is only applied in `test.py` and `test_single_view.py`. 
The majority voting (MV) is done on the merged probability maps for a voxel from each view. 
Since it is from great interest to see the actual performance (i.e. after MV) of a model on the validation set, the 
test script has an argument `-e` or `--evaluate` which can be either `train` or `test`. 
This argument specifies which data should be used. For evaluating the performance of the model on the 
train/validation set, this argument has to be `train` else `test`(default).
